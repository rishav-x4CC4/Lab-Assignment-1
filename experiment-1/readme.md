# üìò Binary Search Tree (BST) ‚Äì Recursive vs Iterative

## üìå Introduction
A **Binary Search Tree (BST)** is a binary tree where:  
- Left child < Parent  
- Right child > Parent  
- No duplicates (in standard BST).  

Searching in BST can be implemented in two ways:  
1. **Recursive Approach** ‚Äì Uses function calls.  
2. **Iterative Approach** ‚Äì Uses loops.  

Both methods have the same time complexity but differ in space usage and performance.

## ‚ö° Comparison Table

| Aspect | Recursive BST Search | Iterative BST Search |
|--------|----------------------|-----------------------|
| **Code Simplicity** | Very simple and elegant. Shorter code. | Slightly longer code, less elegant. |
| **Time Complexity (Best)** | O(1) (if key is at root) | O(1) (if key is at root) |
| **Time Complexity (Average)** | O(log n) (balanced BST) | O(log n) (balanced BST) |
| **Time Complexity (Worst)** | O(n) (skewed BST) | O(n) (skewed BST) |
| **Space Complexity** | O(h), where h = tree height (stack frames). | O(1), no extra memory needed. |
| **Overhead** | Function call overhead due to recursion. | No overhead, uses loop. |
| **Risk** | Stack overflow possible in skewed trees. | No stack overflow risk. |
| **Performance** | Slower in practice (due to recursion overhead). | Faster in practice (no recursion overhead). |
| **Ease of Understanding** | Easier for learning and small problems. | Preferred in large-scale applications. |

## üõ†Ô∏è Programs Implemented

### Recursive BST
- Insert nodes recursively.  
- Search for elements using recursion.  
- Returns a pointer to the node if found, otherwise NULL.  

### Iterative BST
- Insert nodes recursively (for fairness in comparison).  
- Search for elements using a while loop.  
- Returns a pointer to the node if found, otherwise NULL.

## üìä Final Conclusion
- Both **Recursive** and **Iterative BST search** have **O(log n)** average time complexity.  
- **Iterative search is more efficient** in terms of memory and execution speed.  
- **Recursive search is easier to implement** and better for learning purposes.
