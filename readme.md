# ðŸ“˜ Design and Analysis of Algorithms â€“ Lab Experiments

This repository contains the implementation of **DAA experiments** organized into 9 folders.  
Each experiment demonstrates a different algorithmic strategy with its own **README.md** and implementation files.

## ðŸ“‚ Experiment Overview

### **Experiment 1-4: Divide and Conquer Approach**

1. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**
   - Implementation of both **iterative** and **recursive** BST search.
   - Performance comparison of recursive vs iterative approaches.

2. **Merge Sort & Quick Sort**
   - Implementation of divide-and-conquer based Merge Sort and Quick Sort.
   - Performance comparison for the same dataset.

3. **Matrix Multiplication**
   - Implementation of **Strassenâ€™s matrix multiplication method**.
   - Comparison with the traditional matrix multiplication method.

### **Experiment 5-9: Greedy & Dynamic Programming Approach**

5. **Activity Selection Problem**
   - Implementation of the greedy algorithm for activity selection.
   - Demonstrates clear understanding of greedy approach.

6. **Matrix Chain Multiplication**
   - Implementation using **Dynamic Programming**.
   - Analysis of how parenthesis positioning impacts multiplication time.

7. **Shortest Path Algorithms**
